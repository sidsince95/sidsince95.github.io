 Hello, I'm Siddhartha.

I am an aspiring Quant Researcher with proven work experience in Qunatitative Risk. 
I am currently pursuing my MS in Quantitative Computational Finance (QCF) at Georgia Tech, with a focus to eventually venture into Quantitative Research or similar fields. I am interested in Bayesisan Statistics, Stochastic processes, Alpha Research, and exploring statistical arbitrage strategies.
I am using this blog mainly as repo to share my learnings, projects I am working on and learnings. 
Thanks for stopping by, hope you find something interesting.
